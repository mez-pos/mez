# STATE

## Current phase

**Phase 10 - Back office**
File: `docs/phases/phase-10.md`. Phase 09's tasks are all done; its
done-when (a human checks a Z-report against a hand-computed day, and an
export a bookkeeper would use) is still owed, so it stays unticked below.

## Last completed task

**Redesign, Task 9: screen specs** (`docs/phases/redesign.md`). Docs
only. Every spec in `docs/design/screens/` and `components.md` now
speaks the mez language: the serif, tabular figures, 48 and 56px
targets, green for the primary, terracotta for late and for where you
are, the table tones as built, the kitchen on espresso night. The three
specs that cited the Nofiltr archive now name it as history and point at
tokens.md and the mez reference. It finishes the redesign's tasks; its
done-when, a person walking the spine and seeing no old screen, is owed.
Before it, Tasks 1 to 8 (ADR-127, ADR-128).

## Next task

**Phase 10, Task 6: Settings.** Venue details, tax profile, invoice
series, currency and rounding, timezone, financial year start, printers
and station mapping, devices, receipt templates, shift and tip rules,
backup configuration. Far larger than one session: split it first,
commit the split, and stop. Known broken below lists what earlier tasks
left for it (stations, courses and tax classes have no write path; the
day start, variance threshold and tip rule are constants;
`settings.edit` gates Floor plan and Printers already). Build its
screens in the mez language from the start: `docs/design/tokens.md`, and
`docs/design/reference/mez/mez Desktop Management.dc.html` for settings.

## Known broken / in progress

- Redesign (ADR-128): screens are restyled through the primitives only.
  The specs' layouts were not re-read against the mez screen files,
  only their vocabulary and rules. Not seen by eye: card and
  UPI tender, split, the invoice panel, a menu card with a photo, the
  discount, note, approval and tickets sheets, a past bill and its
  refund sheet, the print queue, the reconciliation after a count,
  closing stock, floor states other than free and ordered, move and
  join, the kitchen's waiting tone, order and line notes, a voided
  line and Recall, a toast. In the back office: menu
  choices, recipes, roles, Z-reports, tips, audit, printers, and the
  sales screen after the charts turned green. Charts are one colour;
  the design's green, terracotta, mustard order waits for a chart with
  more than one series. The
  drawer count's face values sit right-aligned in their column, as
  before the redesign. NumPad keys use `sunken`, a stand-in on night that matches
  the canvas: no night screen has a keypad yet. Menu table cells wrap at
  1366px (Task 7).

- Audit (ADR-117): discounts and refunds recorded before Task 4c show
  "Not recorded" for who authorised them. The Person filter lists active
  staff only (it reads `GET /api/v1/staff`); a deactivated person's rows
  show by name but cannot be filtered on. The audit screen has no CSV
  button yet (the route exists, ADR-119). The analysis (ADR-122) sums
  what each correction was worth to its bill, not money out of the drawer.
- CSV (ADR-119): each sheet reads the range again. The Tally files skip
  the formula guard and the byte order mark the report files have.
- Sales screen (ADR-120, ADR-121): tried with one day of sales and no
  credit notes, refunds or discounts, so the heatmap was seen with one
  cell only (its layout over many hours is tested in vitest, not by eye).
  A CSV is in the server's order, not the table's sort.
- Corrections (ADR-123): the browser run had one person, so a row for a
  guest, "not recorded" or someone removed was not seen by eye. Back from
  the trail returns `/sales` to seven days. A deactivated person's link
  shows "Someone no longer active" in the Person box (not seen by eye).
  A sales download and a corrections download can run at once. The range is not in the URL, so a reload returns to
  seven days. A CSV has not been opened in Excel itself. Left open past
  04:00, the range stays yesterday's and no quick range shows pressed.
- Reports (ADR-118): the screen lacks 5d to 5f. A range projects every order
  it touches from its first event; a year at a busy venue may take seconds.
  Items and categories are named as the menu stands now. The day start is
  the shift's constant.
- Stock cost (ADR-124): movements from before migration 00028 have no
  cost. Nothing shows a cost's history; a new cost is for stock moved
  from then on.
- Closing stock (ADR-125, ADR-126): a shift with no closing count is not
  listed. Items are named as they are now. The browser run had one close
  on one day; several shifts and a partly costed item were tested in Go
  and vitest, not by eye. No subtotal per shift on screen.
- Stock (ADR-111 to ADR-114): The
  closing count cannot be skipped while items are marked. A close uses today's
  recipes, not the ones when the line was rung up. A sold movement needs a
  real staff id: the guest channel (phase 11) must supply one. A movement
  entered by hand after the closing drawer count records no shift (the
  closing count names its own, ADR-114).
- Photos (ADR-110): `<data dir>/photos/` is not backed up by Litestream
  (phase 12 must add it); unreferenced photo files are never swept; the
  guest app does not show photos yet.
- Sold out (ADR-109): only the back office can mark it, not the till; the
  server does not refuse a sold-out item rung up (AddLine is unchecked);
  a till with a wrong clock ends it at the wrong time.
- Menu editor (ADR-106, ADR-107): no `Idempotency-Key` on
  its routes, as with printers. Duplicate item names are allowed. No
  write path yet for stations, courses or tax classes (Task 6). An item's
  groups save in a second request after the item (ADR-108). A negative
  choice price is not checked against the items offering it. A venue
  whose tax profile changes to one needing
  HSN keeps items without one until each is edited (Task 6 must handle
  this). The table scrolls sideways below about 1100px of content width.
  Retiring an item shows no "open tickets keep it" note. Form controls
  use the shared `inputClass`, which does not set the 16px control size
  tokens.md asks for (the printers form has the same gap).

- Shell (ADR-105): tried as owner and manager (Task 4b); a cashier sees
  the dashboard alone (vitest). Printers, floor and Z-reports still carry
  their own "Back office" link above the title, now redundant with the
  navigation. Permissions changed mid-session reach the shell at the next
  sign-in or reload.

- Carried from phase 04, owned by no task yet:
  - The done-when script against the real binary. The same loop now runs
    in process on the real stack (ADR-092); the binary itself is left for
    phase 12's installer smoke test.
  - A `float64` lint rule for `internal/domain` (`docs/02-domain.md`).
  - A guard that fails the build when `order.State` changes without a bump
    to `order.ProjectionVersion`; today a forgotten bump serves stale
    snapshots.
- Exports (ADR-103, ADR-104): not yet imported into a real TallyPrime;
  its ledgers are mapped by name once in Tally. Shifts closed before
  migration 00020 have no files. A shift whose files cannot be written
  does not close, as with its Z-report.
- Z-report (ADR-097 to ADR-100): categories are the menu's when the
  report is built, not when the item was sold. The printout has no
  by-item lines; the screen does. The till shows only the report its own
  close issued, until reload; the back office list was typechecked and
  API-tested, not tried in a browser. No screen issues a correction yet
  (the API does). A report that cannot be built blocks the close; there is no
  way round that short of fixing the data.
- Tips (ADR-101, ADR-102): hours are typed in at pooling (no timesheets
  until phase 10); a pool is once per shift with no correction; the rule
  and weights have no back office setting (phase 10). The browser run had
  one staff member, so a multi-person or by-hours pool was tested in Go
  and vitest, not by hand; staff can now be added (Task 4a).
- Shifts (ADR-093 to ADR-096): terminals learn of a shift opening,
  counted or closed by polling every 30 seconds, not the stream. Opening
  and closing need shift.manage: a cashier is told to ask a manager, with
  no override sheet. No till screen for cash in or out yet (the API has
  it). The day start is a constant. A payout larger than the drawer is
  not refused. Closing leaves open tickets to carry into the next shift.
  A counted drawer cannot be recounted. The variance threshold has no
  back office setting yet (phase 10); set it in `settings`. Denomination
  tables exist for INR, USD, EUR and GBP only; others count one total.
- `AddLine` is not checked against the menu (price, tax, modifier min/max);
  the menu is now written over HTTP (ADR-106), so this matters more. GST place of supply is always
  the venue's state, so no IGST. `mez setup` cannot finish a US venue.
- `orders.table_id` has no foreign key (ADR-085). Guests left closes and
  clears in two steps, not one transaction; a retry repairs it (ADR-087).
- Nothing stops seating a dirty table over the API; the floor only offers
  Seat on a free one. The floor has no URL of its own (ADR-087).
- A table with two tickets cannot be moved from the floor; the timeline
  names tables by number (ADR-088).
- Never swept: idempotency keys, expired staff sessions, sign-in attempts.
  The pairing rate limiter is per process.
- A bill printed before payment has no number: numbers come with the
  settling payment (ADR-046, ADR-078). Task 4's pre-payment bill layout
  must say it is not a tax invoice.
- A split lives only on the tender screen (ADR-077); by guest picks seats
  there until lines carry them (phase 08).
- The server does not cap a tender's `reference`; the till caps it at 40.
- Printing is ASCII only (ADR-079): non-Latin item names print as "?".
  No physical printer has run the driver yet.
- The Windows spooler's write path is untested on a real printer (ADR-080).
- The cash drawer opens only with the settling receipt, not on a cash part
  payment (ADR-081).
- The ticket rail marks a line Ready but not sent or held by course. No
  `collected` step (ADR-090). A display's station is per device; a void
  on a sent line reaches it within 20 seconds, not at once (ADR-091).
- The till refunds to one payment per credit note (ADR-084); past bills
  search only exact numbers and invoice sequences.
- `make build` does not build under cmd or PowerShell; for the browser,
  `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -tags frontend -o bin/mez ./cmd/mez`.
- A data dir path containing `%` cannot be opened: `internal/db/open.go`
  does not escape the path in its `file:` DSN.
- To try the apps: `mez setup -demo-menu` prints a pairing code; sign
  in as the owner and count a float to open the till
  (`-device-kind back_office` for the back office); pair in the browser. A
  code for the wrong app is refused but its device stays (ADR-068).
- No endpoint returns the venue's name or a staff member's role; the lock
  screen shows the device name and no roles until one does.
- `go test -race` needs cgo, which is banned; `make check` runs without it.
- The domain import test checks direct imports only (ADR-016).
- Tooling: `make` needs `sh` (Git Bash; GnuWin32 make 3.81 works, at
  `C:/Program Files (x86)/GnuWin32/bin/make.exe`). `make check` does not
  rebuild the web bundles: run `make build-web` before trying the browser. `make
  generate` needs sqlc v1.31.1 and can dirty `go.sum` with goose's test
  modules: restore it with `git checkout go.sum`. `bin/mez` has no
  `.exe`, so kill a stray server with `taskkill /F /IM mez`.

## Open questions for the human

- The GitHub repository is still `nofiltr-pos`; the module path is now
  `github.com/byjoellobo/mez` (ADR-127). Rename the repository to match.
- A data directory from before the rename: move it to the new default
  and rename `nofiltr.db` to `mez.db`. Paired browsers pair again.
