# STATE

> This is the handoff file between sessions. Rewrite the top four sections at
> the end of every session. Keep it under 60 lines — it is read first, every
> time, and long state files waste the context the work needs.

## Current phase

**Phase 09 - Shift, blind drawer count, Z-report, tips**
File: `docs/phases/phase-09.md`. Phase 08 is complete.

## Last completed task

**Phase 09, Task 2b: the close-of-day screen** (`terminal-close.md`,
ADR-096), which completes Task 2. With no shift open the register is
"The till is closed": count the float by note and coin, Open the till.
Tickets has **Close the day**: the blind counter, Submit count (with a
confirm), then the reveal (expected, counted, Short/Over/Balanced), the
reason when owed, and Close the shift. A counted shift shows its reveal
on every till until closed. Tried in the browser end to end.

## Next task

**Phase 09, Task 3: Z-report.** Read `docs/phases/phase-09.md`.

## Known broken / in progress

- Carried from phase 04, owned by no task yet:
  - The done-when script against the real binary. The same loop now runs
    in process on the real stack (ADR-092); the binary itself is left for
    phase 12's installer smoke test.
  - A `float64` lint rule for `internal/domain` (`docs/02-domain.md`).
  - A guard that fails the build when `order.State` changes without a bump
    to `order.ProjectionVersion`; today a forgotten bump serves stale
    snapshots.
- Shifts (ADR-093 to ADR-096): terminals learn of a shift opening,
  counted or closed by polling every 30 seconds, not the stream. Opening
  and closing need shift.manage: a cashier is told to ask a manager, with
  no override sheet. No till screen for cash in or out yet (the API has
  it). The day start is a constant. A payout larger than the drawer is
  not refused. Closing leaves open tickets to carry into the next shift.
  A counted drawer cannot be recounted. The variance threshold has no
  back office setting yet (phase 10); set it in `settings`. Denomination
  tables exist for INR, USD, EUR and GBP only; others count one total.
- Phase 09's exception report should count `entered_in_error` removes
  per staff member, apart from manager voids (ADR-073).
- `AddLine` is not checked against the menu (price, tax, modifier min/max);
  no menu writes over HTTP until phase 10. GST place of supply is always
  the venue's state, so no IGST. `nofiltr setup` cannot finish a US venue.
- `orders.table_id` has no foreign key (ADR-085). Guests left closes and
  clears in two steps, not one transaction; a retry repairs it (ADR-087).
- Nothing stops seating a dirty table over the API; the floor only offers
  Seat on a free one. The floor has no URL of its own (ADR-087).
- A table with two tickets cannot be moved from the floor; the timeline
  names tables by number (ADR-088).
- Never swept: idempotency keys, expired staff sessions, sign-in attempts.
  The pairing rate limiter is per process.
- Token gaps (ADR-062): five paper roles are stand-ins; `--vermilion-on`
  on the paper fill is 3.99:1, under AA, and shows on the paper primary
  button in the gallery.
- A bill printed before payment has no number: numbers come with the
  settling payment (ADR-046, ADR-078). Task 4's pre-payment bill layout
  must say it is not a tax invoice.
- A split lives only on the tender screen (ADR-077); by guest picks seats
  there until lines carry them (phase 08).
- The server does not cap a tender's `reference`; the till caps it at 40.
- Printing is ASCII only (ADR-079): non-Latin item names print as "?".
  No physical printer has run the driver yet.
- The Windows spooler's write path is untested on a real printer (ADR-080).
- The cash drawer opens only with the settling receipt, not on a cash part
  payment (ADR-081).
- The ticket rail marks a line Ready but not sent or held by course. No
  `collected` step (ADR-090). A display's station is per device; a void
  on a sent line reaches it within 20 seconds, not at once (ADR-091).
- The till refunds to one payment per credit note (ADR-084); past bills
  search only exact numbers and invoice sequences.
- `make build` does not build under cmd or PowerShell; for the browser,
  `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -tags frontend -o bin/nofiltr ./cmd/nofiltr`.
- A data dir path containing `%` cannot be opened: `internal/db/open.go`
  does not escape the path in its `file:` DSN.
- To try the apps: `nofiltr setup -demo-menu` prints a pairing code; sign
  in as the owner and count a float to open the till
  (`-device-kind back_office` for the back office); pair in the browser. A
  code for the wrong app is refused but its device stays (ADR-068).
- No endpoint returns the venue's name or a staff member's role; the lock
  screen shows the device name and no roles until one does.
- `go test -race` needs cgo, which is banned; `make check` runs without it.
- The domain import test checks direct imports only (ADR-016).
- Tooling: `make` needs `sh` (Git Bash; GnuWin32 make 3.81 works, at
  `C:/Program Files (x86)/GnuWin32/bin/make.exe`). `make check` does not
  rebuild the web bundles: run `make build-web` before trying the browser. `make
  generate` needs sqlc v1.31.1 and can dirty `go.sum` with goose's test
  modules: restore it with `git checkout go.sum`. `bin/nofiltr` has no
  `.exe`, so kill a stray server with `taskkill /F /IM nofiltr`.
